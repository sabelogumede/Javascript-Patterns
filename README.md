# Javascript - Patterns


From course: JavaScript: Patterns

- [Instructor] For this course, you should have a good foundation with JavaScript syntax, especially around ES6, as many of the patterns I explore will be written in this version. If you're not familiar with scoping, classes and many of the initial programming foundations of the language, stop this video and take a few JavaScript courses. Besides this, you can use any type of editor you wish. But if you'd like to follow along in the same editor I use, get Visual Studio Code, or VS Code.
